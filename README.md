I am currently learning the basic of web development at neuefische as a career change. I spend most of my time around practicing boxe, yoga, dancing forro, being a volunteer teacher at ReDi School, cooking with my friends and coding âš¡


-   Fun fact: I decided to live with the person I am living with at the moment based on a five-minute conversation
